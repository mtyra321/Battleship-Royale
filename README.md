# Battleship-Royale


This Battleship Royale is a text based game developed in Python using web sockets. <br>This was created in just a couple weeks in March 2021 as final project for my computer network class at BYU-I. <br>The premise is like the normal battleship game, where each player places various sized ships around the board. <br>The way this game varies from the traditional battleship because it can handle more than 2 players.<br> Each player sets their target at the same time. <br>All players shoot at their target, and the last player remaining wins.
